# OctoPrint-BedReady

Plugin that uses the camera and opencv to determine if the bed matches a reference image indicating that the bed is clear and ready to start a print.

![Screenshot Bed Not Ready](screenshot_bed_not_ready.png)

For the plugin to work properly add `@BEDREADY` at the beginning of your slicer's start gcode. For best results add gcode to your slicer's end gcode to position the head out of the way for the next comparison.

**NOTE:** Lighting, camera view angle changes, and filament color that is similar to the bed can impact accuracy; adjust the Match Percentage setting below to compensate.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
